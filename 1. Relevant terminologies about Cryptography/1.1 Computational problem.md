# 1.1 Computational problem
## Overview
* Introduce the concept and types of computational problems, with a lot vivid graphs and examples.
## 1.1.1 Definition
A computational problem is defined as a task or question that can be solved or answered using a computational process. It typically consists of:

* Input: A description of the data or parameters provided to the problem.<br>
* Output: The desired result or solution based on the input.<br>

## 1.1.2 Example
A computational problem can be formally defined as a function or relation that maps inputs to outputs. For example:

example 1:<br>
* Input: A positive integer n.<br>
* Output: Determine whether n is a prime number.<br>

example 2:<br>
* Input: A positive integer n.<br>
* Output: Find a nontrivial prime factor of n.<br>

    what is notrivial prime factor?

        A nontrivial prime factor of a positive integer n is a prime number that divides n evenly (i.e., without leaving a remainder) and is neither 1 nor n itself.

    For example:

        For n = 15, the nontrivial prime factors are 3 and 5.
        For n = 28, the nontrivial prime factors are 2 and 7.

    In computational complexity, finding a nontrivial prime factor of a number is a problem often associated with number theory and cryptography.

### 1.1.3.1 Decision problem
A decision problem is a computational problem where the answer for every instance is either yes or no. It can be represented as a function that takes an input and returns a boolean value (true or false).<br>

A decision problem is typically represented as the set of all instances for which the answer is yes. 

For example, primality testing can be represented as the infinite set 
```txt
L = {2, 3, 5, 7, 11, ...}
```
### 1.1.3.2 Search problem
A search problem is represented as a relation consisting of all the instance-solution pairs, called a search relation. 

For example, factoring can be represented as the relation
```txt
R = {(n, p) | p is a nontrivial prime factor of n}

, where n is the input and p is the output.

R = {(4, 2), (6, 2), (6, 3), (8, 2), (9, 3), (10, 2), (10, 5)...}
```
### 1.1.3.3 Counting problem
A counting problem asks for the number of solutions to a given search problem.

For example, a counting problem associated with factoring is "Given a positive integer n, count the number of nontrivial prime factors of n."
### 1.1.3.4 Optimization problem
An optimization problem asks for finding a "best possible" solution among the set of all possible solutions to a search problem. Optimization problems are represented by their objective function and their constraints.

![alt text](<image/Optimization problem.png>)

One example is the maximum independent set problem: "Given a graph G, find an independent set of G of maximum size."

```txt
What is an independent set in a graph?

An independent set in a graph G is a subset of vertices such that no two vertices in the subset are adjacent (i.e., there is no edge connecting any pair of vertices in the set).

The maximum independent set of G is the largest possible independent set, meaning it contains the maximum number of vertices while still satisfying the condition that no two vertices in the set are adjacent.

Example:
    Consider the following graph G:
        A -- B
        |    |
        C -- D

    An independent set could be {A, D} because there is no edge between A and D.

    Another independent set could be {B, C}.

    The maximum independent set is {A, D} or {B, C} (both have size 2, which is the largest possible for this graph).

Importance:
    Finding the maximum independent set is an optimization problem because it requires selecting the "best possible" solution (the largest independent set) from all possible independent sets in the graph. This problem is computationally hard and is a well-known NP-hard problem in computational complexity theory.

Applications:
    Resource Allocation: Ensuring that no two conflicting resources (e.g., tasks, jobs, or entities) are selected simultaneously.
    Network Design: Selecting non-interfering nodes in a communication network.
    Scheduling: Assigning tasks or events without conflicts.
```
### 1.1.3.5 Function problem
A function problem is a type of computational problem where the goal is to compute a specific output for a given input. Unlike a decision problem, which only requires a "yes" or "no" answer, a function problem produces a more detailed or complex output.

Example: Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)<br>
* Input: A list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities.
* Output: The shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the starting city.

![alt text](<image/Function problem.png>)

Difference from Decision Problems:
* Decision Problem: "Is there a route shorter than X?" (Answer: Yes/No)
* Function Problem: "What is the shortest route?" (Answer: A specific route and its distance)

## 1.1.4 Promise problems
In computational complexity theory, a promise problem is a type of computational problem where not all possible inputs (binary strings in {0, 1}<sup>\*</sup>) are considered valid instances of the problem. Instead, a subset of {0, 1}<sup>\*</sup> is explicitly defined as the set of valid instances. This is different from standard computational problems, where it is usually assumed that any string in {0, 1}<sup>\*</sup> is a valid input.

![alt text](<image/Promise problems.png>)

Key Characteristics:
* Valid Instances: Only a subset of {0, 1}<sup>\*</sup> is considered valid for the problem. Inputs outside this subset are not required to produce a meaningful answer.
* Disjoint Subsets: Promise problems are often represented as two disjoint subsets:
L<sub>yes</sub>: Instances where the answer is "yes."
L<sub>no</sub>: Instances where the answer is "no."
The valid instances are those in L<sub>yes</sub>  &cup; L<sub>no</sub>.

Example:
* Problem:<br>
"Given a graph G, determine if every independent set in G has size at most 5, or if G has an independent set of size at least 10."

* Valid Instances: Graphs where the maximum independent set size is either:
    * At most 5
    * At least 10.
* Invalid Instances: Graphs where the maximum independent set size is between 6 and 9. These do not satisfy the "promise" and are not valid inputs.

Importance of Promise Problems:<br>

* Hardness of Approximation: a field that studies the algorithmic complexity of finding near-optimal solutions to optimization problems.
* Property Testing: a field of theoretical computer science, concerned with the design of super-fast algorithms for approximate decision making, where the decision refers to properties or parameters of huge objects.
* Interactive Proof Systems: an abstract machine that models computation as the exchange of messages between two parties: a prover and a verifier. The parties interact by exchanging messages in order to ascertain whether a given string belongs to a language or not. The prover is assumed to possess unlimited computational resources but cannot be trusted, while the verifier has bounded computation power but is assumed to be always honest. Messages are sent between the verifier and prover until the verifier has an answer to the problem and has "convinced" itself that it is correct.

Promise problems allow researchers to focus on specific subsets of inputs, making them a powerful tool for analyzing computational complexity in specialized contexts.
